    "To simplify the problem, I will first break it into two parts: satellite selection and bike routing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Satellite selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As all satellites are relatively close to the other customers, distance between them and the other customers will not be considered in the satellite selection model. This is similar to saying that the satellite selection will be independent of the bike routes that result from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will select the satellites based on the requirement that one van per satellite (via back-and-forth trips) can supply the total average demand within 90 minutes. As the satellites have limited capacity, this naturally assumes that bikes are removing the stock at the satellites before the van comes back with more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this problem, we use variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_s$: binary variable indicating whether satellite $s$ is chosen.\n",
    "$y_s$: integer variable indicating number of round trips to satellite $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$SA$: set of possible satellites, such that $s \\in SA$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will minimize cost of renting the satellite locations and of the transport during the 90-minute window.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ z = \\sum\\limits_{s \\in SA}a_s x_s + b_s y_s$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $a_s$ is the daily satellite cost: $a_s = {60, 120, 130, 50}$,\n",
    "* $b_s$ is the cost of a single trip: $b_s = 2\\cdot0.8d_{s} + 100 + 25$\n",
    "    * where $d_{s}$ is the van-distance from the depot to satellite $s$\n",
    "    * 100 and 25 are costs associated with each trip given in the problem statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "If we let $c_s$ be the capacity at each satellite, we can write the constraints as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum\\limits_{s\\in SA}c_s y_s \\geq q_{total}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $q_{total}$ is the total average demand at each customer.\n",
    "This constraint ensures that all trips to the satellites can at least supply the average demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum\\limits_{s\\in SA}x_s \\leq SA_{max}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $SA_{max}$ is the maximum number of satellites that may be chosen\n",
    "This ensures that no more than the maximum number of satellites are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_s \\leq x_s \\lfloor\\frac{g}{2\\tau_s}\\rceil$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $g$ is the target time frame within which we want to deliver all demand to the satellites (here, 90 min), $/tau_s$ is the van-time from depot to satellite $s$. As $g$ is an approximation anyway, we round the number of possible trips to nearest integer.\n"

With a 60 minute window for deliveries, objective is €642, using satellites 0, 2, and 3 With a 120 minute window for deliveries, objective is €576, and only satellite 3 is used. With a 90 minute window, objective is €582, and satellites 2 and 3 are used. I chose to go with the 90 minute window, as this simulation is based on only averages with no variability, and 2 satellites offer more flexibility. Furthermore, this only costs €6 more."
